Program Design


Sam's Program - Looking people who are SICK
UNION Design

ArrayList ( the people related to each other)
data[ID] -> ArrayList data
search funtion -> look for people who are sick with specific ID

-Save anything from the text in list

-if it is not search data, Save it in the ArrayList.

-Compare the next data, whether it is in all the previous Arraylist

-If one of the is in the ArrayList, the Add everything into the ArrayList
	PS. in the program, Sam assumed if there is one person is sick, the whole group will be
	    assumed too

-If Not, then create a new ArrayList

-Make sure there won't be any same value in the Arraylist, and only one value can be avaiable in
in the Arraylist

-and So on

-If see "search" for data, then start to search from the beginning. See whether there is any
arraylist that contains

-If there is one, just print out the whole arraylist

-If not, just print the data that you are looking for

-and so on

-till to the end of file.
